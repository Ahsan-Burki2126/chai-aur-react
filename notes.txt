what is a vite?
vite is a bundler that comine all the files in your folder structure and gives it to the broswer.


when we create create-react-app its a utility that creates the basic folder structure for react arrp and give us some files and folders 
all of this files and folders has some purposes but the main folder that we will work on is package.json.
in package.json there are different things we come across but in the scripts section we get 3 diffefernt  scripts.

1)start ====> to start the application on our local server it serves the source file.

2)build ====> to run the application on production server it basically creates an entire differnt folder and serves that folder from 
server to client.the behaviour of that file maybe different from our source app or at our local production.

3)test =====> test the application.

4) eject =====> help in ejection from react to other libray,language or framework.


Note: there are differnt types of bundlers that we come across in our daily life , create-react-app is one of them.but the most effiecient in my opinion is 
vite.vite gives us very less ammount of modules that made it easy.the main difference between vite and create-react-app is that 
create-react-app gives us modules folder wwhile in vite we have to install the packages and modules later on.
